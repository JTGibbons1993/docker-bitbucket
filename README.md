# Docker Image for Atlassian Bitbucket Server 4.2.0

this repository provide the currently latest version of Atlassians sourcecode repository/review software [Bitbucket](https://de.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) including the recommended [MySQL java connector](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.tar.gz) for an easy and painless docker based Bitbucket installation. Take note that this repository will be used inside our docker atlassian application workbench sources, which are also available on [Github](https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-atlassian-wb) as soon as documentation is completed. *In this workbench we've combined several Atlassian products (JIRA, Confluence and Bitbucket) using advanced docker features like docker-compose based service management, data-container and links*

## Preparation
We recommend the [latest Docker version](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For simple system integration and supervision we suggest [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using MacOS or Windows as host operating system, you may take the advantage of [Docker Machine](https://www.docker.com/docker-machine) for Docker's VM management. Bitbucket requires a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, so we'll provide a specific Docker Compose configuration file to showcase both a Bitbucket-MySQL link and a data-container feature configuration. Use the installation guides of provided links down below to comply your Docker preparation process.

## Installation-Method 1, using docker
These steps will show you the generic, pure docker-based installation of our Atlassian-Bitbucket image/container (the classic approach).  *We also will provide (and recommend) a docker-compose based installation in this documentation (â†— Installation-Method 2)*.

1. checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-bitbucket.git .
```

2. build Bitbucket (version 4.2.0) image on your local docker host, naming image "dunkelfrosch/bitbucket:4.1.0"

```bash
docker build -t dunkelfrosch/bitbucket:4.2.0
```

3. start your new Bitbucket application container (opening application port 7990 and internal-ssh port 7999)

```bash
docker run -d -p 7990:7990 -p 7999:7999 dunkelfrosch/bitbucket 
```
	
4. finish your installation using atlassian's browser based configuration
just navigate to `http://[dockerhost]:7990`. Please take note, that your dockerhost will depend on your host system. If you're using docker on your mac, you'll properly using docker-machine or the deprecated native boot2docker vbox image. In this case your 'dockerhost' ip will be the vbox ones (just enter `docker-machine ls` and grab your named machine's ip from there. In my case, (image down below) the resulting setup-ip will be <strong>192.168.99.100:7990</strong> on any other "real" linux system the setup-ip should be 127.0.0.1/localhost (port will be the tomcat application used port 7990)

4.1 The following steps will help you to finalize your bitbucket server web-based configuration

4.1.1 Select "external" database from configuration options and choose MySQL as type

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qrp94qfwtsqh4if/bitbucket_setup_001.png)

4.1.2 Enter the following credentials for your database (take note, that the mysql host will be available as your in docker-compose defined service key 'bitbucket_mysql' or by container-name 'df-atls-bitbucket-mysql' directly):
_the initialization and base import of the db will take a while (may be up to 3 minutes)_

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/wxc3sc6pnvlg2pd/bitbucket_setup_003.png)

| MySQL Host               | username                   | password            | database            |
|:------------------------ |:-------------------------- |:------------------- |:------------------- |
| df-atls-bitbucket-mysql  | root                       | secretpassword      | bitbucket           |
| (or) bitbucket_mysql     |                            |                     |                     |

4.1.3 Enter your license key

4.1.4 Create your bitbucket administrator user account and proceed to login (do not connect with JIRA!)

4.1.5 Welcome to your bitbucket server :)

## Installation-Method 2, docker-compose
The following steps will show you an alternative way of your Bitbucket service container installation using Docker Compose (the recommended approach).

1. checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-bitbucket.git .
```

2. create a docker-compose.yml file in your target directory (or using the existing one), insert the following lines (docker-compose.yml in ./sample-configs/ directory). 

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/rj8zsfmkor4ynj5/dc_setup_001.png)

3. start your bitbucket container by docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d bitbucket
```

4. (*optional*) rename the resulting image after successful build (we'll use our image auto-name result here)

```bash
docker tag dfdockerbitbucket_bitbucket dunkelfrosch/bitbucket:4.2.0
```

5. the result should by a running container and an available local bitbucket image

## Installation-Method 3, Docker Compose using DB (advanced)
Bitbucket needs a relational DB and for safety reasons we suggest using data-only container features. Take a look inside your *./sample-config* path, we've provided a few sample Docker Compose yaml config files below to show you those feature implementations.

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-dc.yml**
> sample configuration for data-container feature

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-linkdb.yml**
> sample configuration for linking mysql container directly

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-v2.yml**
> sample configuration for the new docker-compose format (valid since version 1.6.n of docker-compose)

I've extend the sample configuration files with corresponding parts of new docker-compose v2 formatted ones (this files will be suffixed by 'v2')


## container access and maintenance
You can check container health by accessing logs of inner tomcat/bitbucket processes directly as long as the container is still running. As you can see in this screenshot, Atlassian Bitbucket was starting successfully (*Let's ignore some minor warnings ;)* )

```bash
docker logs df-atls-bitbucket
```

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/betzx0n620v94ae/dc_logs_001.png)

You can log in easily to your running Bitbucket container to take a deeper look in your Bitbucket service process. *This Bitbucket build provides midnight-commander as terminal extension accessible typing `mc` in your container session shell*.

```bash
docker exec -it --user root df-atls-bitbucket /bin/bash
```
